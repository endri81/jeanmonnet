bio: The intensive course “The application of algebraic methodology as a foundation for new software technology and digitalization”addresses the application of algebraic methodology as a foundation for software technology, and to examine how it can be used to provide practical mathematical alternatives to the ad hoc methods commonly used in software development. In particular course takes in consideration EU best practices and advances on using this methodology in data security and high-security cryptography for the future generation.
