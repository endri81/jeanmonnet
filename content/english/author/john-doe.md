Polytechnic University of Tirana (PUT) is committed to implement study programs and policies aligned with EU Agenda.
The PUT is trying to be part of European projects and to impact some important disciplines like Physics, Mathematics and Engineering. We
believe it’s important to efficiently encourage and support STEM skills development, advocating STEM studies and careers, promoting women
participation in STEM, encouraging teachers’ professional development as well as creating a healthy environment for better communication
between professors and students. With this in mind, we aim to establish the module “Innovative STEM teaching practices in Albania towards
European Integration”.
