### Kick-off Meeting

The three-year Erasmus+ project ISTA-EU (Innovative STEM teaching practices in Albania towards European Integration) was launched on 22 November 2022 in Tirana, Albania. In a very friendly atmosphere, project members had the pleasure of meeting Polytechnic University of Tirana Vice-Rector for the educational area Prof. Akli Fundo and Dean of Mathematical Engineering and Physics Engineering Faculty Prof. Shkelqim Kuka. Also present were vice-deans of the Mathematical Engineering and Physics Engineering Faculty, professors, and students interested in learning more about opportunities offered by the ISTA-EU project. This first transnational meeting was hosted by the Polytechnic University of Tirana.

The project ISTA-EU is co-funded by the European Commission within the framework of Jean Monnet Actions running under Erasmus+ to support teaching, learning, research and debates on various aspects of the European Union.

## Objectives of the ISTA-EU Project

The project aims at introducing EU studies at PUT, promoting teaching and research in the EU impact on STEM, fostering the dialogue between the academic world and society, including local and state level policymakers, civil servants, civil society actors, representatives of the different levels of education and of the media, and promoting STEM and EU impact on STEM in Albania.

## Work Meetings

The meeting at the Polytechnic University of Tirana was a combination of the first transnational meeting for the project team, coordinators from the institution, and a comprehensive introduction on various possibilities created by this project and future support to be offered by the hosting institution.

The introduction sessions, which were attended by a total of 16 professors and coordinators, focused on topics to be taught within the framework of the project, distance learning and teaching, universal design of courses, and creative ICT tools to be used in teaching.
