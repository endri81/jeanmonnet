### Course “Gaining experience in automated Electronic Design Systems based on Micro controllers" starting

Course “Gaining experience in automated Electronic Design Systems based on Micro controllers" started on on Tuesday 20 December at the headquarters of Polytechnic University of Tirane within frame of Innovative STEM teaching practices in Albania towards European Integration project . 

The seminar started on Tuesday 20 December and was the first to be organised at the PTU since project was officially launched. The course was conducted by Dr. Joan Jani.

## About the course
The series of seminars “Gaining experience in automated Electronic Design Systems based on Micro controllers focuses on :

  - Arduino programming

  - IR sensors for measuring distance

  - Temperature sensor and the connection with the Arduino micro-controller

  - Python programming Language

  - Integration of Python with the Arduino micro-controller

  - Creating a web page with data acq

## Objectives of the ISTA-EU project
The project aims at introducing EU studies at PUT. Promote teaching and research in the EU impact on STEM. Foster the dialogue between the academic world and society, including local and state level policymakers, civil servants, civil society actors, representatives of the different levels of education and of the media. Promote STEM and EU impact on STEM in Albania.

## About the event

The library of PTU was used for this course and in total 30 participants attended the course, 12 of whom were from graduate courses and 18 of them were from undergraduates. Those attending were introduced with project objectives, European approach and goals  and started to programm with Arduino.
