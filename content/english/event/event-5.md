### About the Event

ScienceFemSalon was organized with the participation of special guests including Antigona Uka, founder and executive director at Kosovo Center for Digital Education (KCD), who specializes in higher education policy. She introduced the opportunities and challenges of women's participation in STEM fields.

In 2024, during Erasmus Days, the Vice Rector of the Faculty, Prof. Shehu, also addressed these important issues regarding women in STEM in her presentation, highlighting ongoing efforts to promote gender equality in scientific and technical education.
