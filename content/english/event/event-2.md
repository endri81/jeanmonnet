### Course "Gaining experience in automated Electronic Design Systems based on Microcontrollers"

The course "Gaining experience in automated Electronic Design Systems based on Microcontrollers" started on Tuesday 20 December at the headquarters of the Polytechnic University of Tirana within the framework of the Innovative STEM teaching practices in Albania towards European Integration project.

The seminar started on Tuesday 20 December and was the first to be organized at PTU since the project was officially launched. The course was conducted by Dr. Joan Jani.

## About the Course

The series of seminars "Gaining experience in automated Electronic Design Systems based on Microcontrollers" focuses on:

- Arduino programming
- IR sensors for measuring distance
- Temperature sensor and the connection with the Arduino microcontroller
- Python programming language
- Integration of Python with the Arduino microcontroller
- Creating a web page with data acquisition

## Objectives of the ISTA-EU Project

The project aims at introducing EU studies at PUT, promoting teaching and research in the EU impact on STEM, fostering the dialogue between the academic world and society, including local and state level policymakers, civil servants, civil society actors, representatives of the different levels of education and of the media, and promoting STEM and EU impact on STEM in Albania.

## About the Event

The library of PTU was used for this course and in total 30 participants attended, 12 of whom were from graduate courses and 18 from undergraduate programs. Those attending were introduced to project objectives, the European approach and goals, and started to program with Arduino.
